# R-Exercises

In this repository, I will deposit the exercises done in different online learning platforms. I focused on R, especially for its usefulness as a Data Science and statistical programming language. 

I deposited the exercises and projects created thanks to the Sololearn platform. Sololearn has the largest collection of code learning content, also at advanced level. The platform is integrated with a peer community that create additional contents for facilitating an efficient and effective coder skill improvement. Further, the platform interact with real-life code samples and individual assignments, and egange in interactive community conversations along the way.
Solearn is 2021 Best Computer Coding Education Solution (award winner) and 2021 Tech&Learning Higher Ed Winner.
